## BACKGROUND AND CONCEPT

### The concept behind a mindfulness app with daily tasks is to incorporate mindfulness practices into one's daily routine in a manageable and sustainable way.
### By assigning daily tasks, the app aims to make mindfulness a habit and a natural part of one's day. 
### The tasks can range from guided meditations, breathing exercises, journaling prompts, or simple mindfulness exercises like paying attention to one's senses or performing a task mindfully.
### The purpose is to provide users with an easy and convenient way to stay mindful and present, no matter how busy their schedules may be. By completing daily tasks, users can improve their mental well-being, reduce stress and anxiety, and cultivate inner peace over time.
